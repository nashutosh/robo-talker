tkinter: The standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, used for creating graphical user interfaces.
pyttsx3: A text-to-speech conversion library in Python that works offline.
Initialization (__init__ method):
self.root: The main window of the application.
self.root.title("Robo Speaker 1.1 by Ashutoh Thakur"): Sets the title of the main window.
self.engine = pyttsx3.init(): Initializes the text-to-speech engine.
self.label: A label widget prompting the user to enter text to speak.
self.entry: An entry widget where the user can type the text they want to be spoken.
self.speak_button: A button that triggers the speak_text method when clicked.
self.exit_button: A button that closes the application when clicked.
Retrieving and Speaking Text:
text = self.entry.get(): Retrieves the text entered by the user in the entry widget.
If the text is "exit" (case-insensitive), the application quits (self.root.quit()).
Otherwise, the text-to-speech engine speaks the entered text (self.engine.say(text)) and waits until the speech is finished (self.engine.runAndWait()).
Script Entry Point:
root = tk.Tk(): Creates the main window of the application.
app = RoboSpeakerApp(root): Initializes the RoboSpeakerApp class with the main window.
root.mainloop(): Starts the Tkinter event loop, which waits for user interaction and keeps the application running.
